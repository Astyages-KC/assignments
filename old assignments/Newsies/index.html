    <h1>Aliens!</h1>
    <h2>Fact or Fiction?</h2>
    <div>
    <p class="open">Many people ask if aliens exist.  We will be exploring some common beliefs about this fascinating story.</p>
    <p class="facts"><b>Stars</b><br />There are billions of stars in our galaxy, about 200 billion!  If only 1% of them had a planet with life that is around 2 billion.  If 1% of those had intelligent life that is around 20 million other intelligent life forms.  So where are these aliens?  Some people think we have been visited by aliens and others do not believe it.</p>
    <p class="timeline"><b>Time</b><br />Our planet is old, about 4.5 billion years old.  Humans have only been around for about 200,000 years or about .004.4% of that time.  What if the aliens did visit us but it was long before humans existed.  There is a 99.995% they never saw us because we were not around to view.</p>
    <p class="difference"><b>DNA</b><br />The difference between our DNA and the DNA of a chimpanzee is about 1-2%.  What if the aliens DNA were 2% different then ours?  Would they view us the same way we view the chimps?  Cute and interesting but not too bright.  Chances are that their dna would be so different it would be like us trying to communicate with a mushroom.</p>
    <p class="huge"><b>Vast</b><br />Space is huge.  Talk about finding a needle in a haystack...  If you could travel at the speed of light it would take you 100,000 years to go from one side of the galaxy to the other.  An alien species would need to travel faster than the speed of light to explore our galaxy.  Traveling through hyperspace or warping space makes for a great sci-fi show, but even our greatest scientist cannot figure out how to do that.  If there were an alien race that had that technology they would be super advanced.  Even then finding that needle in a haystack would be difficult.  And once they arrived here they would think us very primitive.  Perhaps we would make great pets!</p>
    <p class="fake"><b>Abduction</b><br />Many people believe they have been abducted by aliens.  Although they have no verifiable proof of these claims.</p>
    <p class="sight"><b>Sightings</b><br />There have been sightings of strange objects in the sky all over the world.  However, jumping to the conclusion that the objects are of alien origin without ruling out many other possibilities seems unscientific.</p>
